0 build client (they have a custom retryTransport logic for this)
1. check if request is blocking or non-blocking
2. parse model reference (slug -> owner, name, version, version ID)
has functions and regex for parsing multiple combinations

3 prediction strategy
	encode input data into json
	create request body (version, input, webhook, stream)
	add headers & timeout
	client request
	converts json to Prediction object

4 check if prediction is in terminal state
5 get model version and openapi spec
6 transforms output to FileOutput object if it is URL
